# Leaflet - Creating the Earthquake Visualization !
## Background

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, 
but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, <br> We have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and <br>
other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.<br>

## Steps taken:
- Using Leaflet, We created a map that plots all the earthquakes from our dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
- Our data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
- We used (mag) depth of the earth as the measures for each earthquake.
- Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
- Further Created a legend that will provide context for your map data.

#### Map Visual look like this:
